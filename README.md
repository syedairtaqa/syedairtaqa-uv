## 📖 About the Project

This is my first attempt at using GitHub for project management and code sharing. The goal is to understand:

- How Git works  
- How to write clean, documented code  
- How to maintain and share projects publicly or privately  
- How to collaborate using GitHub features like pull requests, issues, etc.
